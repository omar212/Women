    "Name": "Ana Caraiani",
    "Description": "Caraiani was born in Bucharest, Romania. She earned her bachelor’s degree summa cum laude from Princeton University in 2007. At Princeton, she wrote her senior thesis on Galois representations under the supervision of Andrew Wiles, widely known for having completed a proof in 1995 of Fermat’s Last Theorem. Caraiani did her doctoral work at Harvard under the supervision of Wiles’s former student, Richard Taylor. Her doctoral dissertation concerned local-global compatibility in the Langlands correspondence. After graduating in 2012, she first taught briefly at the University of Chicago, before returning to Princeton University from 2013 to 2016. While at Princeton, she also served as a Veblen Research Instructor in Mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS). Since 2016, Caraiani has been a Bonn Junior Fellow at the Hausdorff Center for Mathematics (HCM), a highly prestigious mathematics research institute located in Bonn, Germany. She has also been invited for shorter visits to the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute at University of California–Berkeley and the École Normale Supérieure in Paris.",

    "Name": "Marissa A. Mayer",
    "Description": "Mayer was born in Wausau, Wisconsin. She took her bachelor’s degree in symbolic systems in 1997 and her master’s degree in computer science in 1999, both from Stanford University. For both degrees, she specialized in artificial intelligence (AI), including developing a travel advice software system with a natural language user interface. Upon graduation, Mayer interned at SRI International in Menlo Park, California, and at UBS Financial’s research lab based in Zurich, Switzerland. Next, she turned down an offer to teach at Carnegie Mellon University in order to join the then-new Google company as employee number twenty. Mayer was the company’s first female engineer. She started out writing code, as well as supervising small teams tasked with the design and development of Google’s search offerings. Mayer holds several patents in artificial intelligence and interface design. Moving quickly into management, Mayer placed her own personal stamp on the company, especially as the person mainly responsible for the elegant, minimalist look of Google’s home page, with a single search bar centered on the page surrounded by white space. From there, she went on to oversee the launch and development of many of Google’s iconic products, overseeing the development of a host of new AI-based initiatives, including Google AdWords, Google Search, Google Images, Google Maps, Google Product Search, Google Toolbar, iGoogle, and Gmail, among others.",

She competed on the US team at the 45th International Mathematical Olympiad in 2004 in Athens, Greece, where she won a gold medal — a first ever for an American woman. She received her bachelor’s degree summa cum laude in mathematics in 2008 from Harvard University, where while still a undergraduate she published two papers on modular forms in number theory, and a third paper giving the best known upper bounds on superpatterns in the theory of permutation patterns. While at Harvard, she also won the Elizabeth Lowell Putnam Prize for three years running (2005 — 2007), equaling a record previously set by Ioana Dumitriu. Her senior thesis, “Explicit Class Field Theory in Function Fields: Gross-Stark Units and Drinfeld Modules,” won the Hoopes Prize. Following her bachelor’s degree, Miller attended Cambridge University in England for a year on a Churchill Scholarship.",

    "Description": "Burnell (née Bell) was born in Lurgan, Northern Ireland, in the United Kingdom. She became interested in astronomy at an early age. She took her bachelor’s degree in physics in 1965 from the University of Glasgow, and received her PhD in 1969 from the University of Cambridge. While at Cambridge — and still known as Jocelyn Bell — she was enlisted by her doctoral adviser, Antony Hewish, to work with Martin Ryle and others on the construction and testing of a new radio telescope designed to study the then-recently discovered radio sources known as “quasi-stellar objects,” or quasars. In 1967, while poring over data from the new telescope, Bell discovered a never-before-observed type of signal being emitted with great regularity at the rate of about one and one-third pulses per second. She immediately showed the strange signal to her adviser, and the two worked closely together to try to understand what she had found.",

She received her master’s degree in space systems engineering from the Naval Postgraduate School in 1994, and her PhD in Systems Engineering from the University of Virginia in 2004. From 1988 until 1999, Cummings was a naval officer and military pilot. In 1989, she was one of the first women to land a supersonic jet fighter — a Boeing F/A-18 Hornet — on the deck of an aircraft carrier.\n\nCummings began her academic career while still in the Navy, at Pennsylvania State University, afterwards also teaching at Virginia Tech. In 2010, MIT appointed her an Associate Professor in its Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, where she was Director of the Humans and Automation Lab in the Engineering Systems Division. She is currently Associate Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science at Duke University, where once again she is Director of the Humans and Autonomy Lab (the new incarnation of the lab she previously headed up at MIT). She also holds joint appointments with Duke’s Institute of Brain Sciences and Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. Cummings’s research extends across several fields, including human interaction with autonomous vehicle systems, modeling human interaction with complex systems, and decision support design for time-pressured, uncertain systems. In addition, she has a strong interest in the ethics of technology, including the impact of technology on society.",

    "Name": "Frances E. Allen",
    "Description": "Initially given the facetious name of “LGM-1” (for “little green men”) by Bell and Hewish, their discovery was soon conjectured by Thomas Gold to be caused by a highly magnetized, rapidly rotating neutron star. This conjecture proved to be correct, and the phenomenon then became officially known as a “pulsating star,” or pulsar. In 1968, Bell married Martin Burnell and, after taking her degree the following year, at first worked only part-time. Eventually, the couple divorced and Burnell resumed a full-time academic career, initially as Professor of Physics at the Open University (1991 — 2001). After occupying a visiting professorship at Princeton University, she next served as Dean of Science at the University of Bath (2001 — 2004). During this time, she also served as President of the Royal Astronomical Society (2002 — 2004), and later as President of the Institute of Physics (2008 — 2010). She is currently Visiting Professor of Astrophysics at the University of Oxford. Though passed over for the Nobel Prize for Physics awarded to Hewish and Ryle in 1974, Burnell was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2003 and was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 2007, among many other honors too numerous to mention.",
