Bass Professorship in the School of Humanities and Sciences;.[1] In addition, Bertozzi is an Investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)[2]and is the former Director of the Molecular Foundry, a nanoscience research center at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.[3] She received a MacArthur \"genius\" award at age 33,[4] making her one of the younger scientists to receive this award.[5] In 2010 she was the first woman to receive the prestigious Lemelson-MIT Prize faculty award. She is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Inventors, and the Institute of Medicine. In 2014, it was announced that Bertozzi would lead ACS Central Science, the American Chemical Society's first peer-reviewed open access journal that offers all content freely to the public.[6]",

    "Name": "Ana Caraiani",
    "Description": "Ana Caraiani is a Romanian-American mathematician, who is a Royal Society University Research Fellow and Senior Lecturer at Imperial College London.[1] Her research interests include algebraic number theory and the Langlands program.\n\nIn 2001, Caraiani became the first Romanian female competitor in 25 years at the International Mathematical Olympiad, where she won a silver medal. In the following two years, she won two gold medals.[1][2][3]\n\nAs an undergraduate student at Princeton University, Caraiani was a two-time Putnam Fellow (the only female competitor at the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition to win more than once) and Elizabeth Lowell Putnam Award winner.[1][4][5] In 2007 the Association for Women in Mathematics gave her their Alice T. Schafer Prize.[1][4] Caraiani graduated summa cum laude from Princeton in 2007, with an undergraduate thesis on Galois representations supervised by Andrew Wiles.[1]\n\nCaraiani did her graduate studies at Harvard University under the supervision of Wiles' student Richard Taylor, earning her Ph.D. in 2012 with a dissertation concerning local-global compatibility in the Langlands correspondence.[1][6] After spending a year as an L.E. Dickson Instructor at the University of Chicago, she returned to Princeton and the IAS as a Veblen Instructor.[1] In 2016 she was appointed a Bonn Junior Fellow and moved to the Hausdorff Center for Mathematics. She moved to Imperial in 2017.",
